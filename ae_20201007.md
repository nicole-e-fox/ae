A colleague has asked for your help in creating a data dictionary for an undocumented SAS library.
 
The colleague needs the following details in the specified order:
<ol>
<li>the name of the source table</li>
<li>the logical position of the column in the SAS dataset</li>
<li>column name</li>
<li>column label</li>
<li>whether the column is numeric or character</li>
<li>column length</li>
<li>SAS format information.</li>
</ol>

Write a sample program for your colleague that generates the desired output using the SASHELP library as an example.
